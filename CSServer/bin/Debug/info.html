    <br /> Datacentre Alpha is a Private Remote Access Service Machine which started development in 18/11/2019 to store
    <br /> logs, data, transmission etc. it uses top-quality SHA512 encryption to encrpyt all
    <br />sensitive data such as login details(passwords), access levels(ranks) and other private information.
    <br />
    <br />Datacentre Alpha has 3 ranks in total, ADMIN, MEMBER and GUEST.
    <br />
    <br />GUEST accounts are public access accounts, to log into a guest account just use "guest" for both username and password.
    <br />Note however that guest accounts have very limited accessibility.
    <br />
    <br />MEMBER accounts are registered accounts, only trusted users will have ownership of MEMBER accounts, MEMBER accounts have
    <br />much more access than GUEST accounts and can access certain data and transmission logs for private usage
    <br />
    <br />ADMIN accounts are private accounts, only organization members have access to admin accounts, admins have full control of
    <br />the machine (except for the server console which only exists on the machine's central mainframe) and have access to all data, logs and transmissions.
